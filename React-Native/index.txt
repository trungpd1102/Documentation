1. React Native app dose not accept localhost directly.
To connect, have to connect via IP address
- Example: baseUrl = "http://192.168.1.9:5000" with '192.168.1.9' is your device(computer) that server is running

2. Switch remote debug mode 
- MS : ctrl + m, MAC OS : cmd + m,
- iPhone/android: shake your device then look for the "disable Remote Debug JS" and click it.
